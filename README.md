# Hey i am **Danial Arif**

``I imported a Card component from Shadcn which has input for email and password which i directly connected to the mongoDb atlas so whenever someone try to enter anything in the input that post it in the mongoDb atlas.``

``So it's just practice page if anyone wanna try give it a shout but do not put your real email and its password cause i can see it :) haha``
